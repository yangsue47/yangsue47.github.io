# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview
The task of this project was to build an interactive webpage that displays visual information upon making changes. 

Roza's job is to create an interactive webpage to support Improbable Beef's goal of finding a bacteria culture that can potentially be used to synthesize beef.

## Results
Using the plotly library in javascript, we were able to extract information from a json file to create the necessary components of the website. Upon selecting a test subject, the charts and information of the test subject were displayed in the proper context.

## Summary
Improbable Beef would be proud of Roza's work. See the public webpage for the interaction and additional information: https://yangsue47.github.io/index.html
